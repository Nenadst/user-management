This is a [Next.js][Mongodb] project. I provided you JSON files for roles and users, you can import them into mongodb. I also provide you with an .env-example file, you just need to rename it to .env and uncoment lines(I know that it is not the best practice, but it is just because it will be easier for you to run the application). I also added the delete option for easier application management in the test phase.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

#then

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
